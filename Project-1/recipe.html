                <p>This recipe my mom has made for years, and it is a family favorite! It's perfect for a night where
                    you dont want to have to think about cooking, or if you are feeling sick and in need of a warm and
                    soothing pick-me-up. Instantpot meals are good for people who do not have time to prepare meals as
                    you just throw in the ingredients, turn on the pot, and let it cook for a few hours. Then done! A
                    nice warm dinner ready in a few hours. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>3 chicken breasts</li>
                    <li>2, 10.5 ounce cans condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
                    <li>1 small yellow onion, dices</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
                    <li>1 tsp dried parsley</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>8 oz egg noodles, uncooked</li>

                <h2 class="headings">Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>To a 5qt or 6qt slow cooker or larger, add chicken breasts, cream of chicken soup, onion,
                        garlic, and chicken stock, and then season with dried parsley, salt, and pepper. Give everything
                        a quick stir. Add the pieces of butter, cover, and cook on LOW for 3-4 hours, or on HIGH for 2-3
                        hours.</li>

                    <li>When the internal temperature of the chicken is 165°F/74°C, take it out and put it on a cutting
                        board.</li>

                    <li>Add uncooked noodles and frozen vegetables to the crockpot. Stir so that the noodles are
                        submerged.</li>

                    <li>Shred the chicken and return it to the crockpot. Cook, covered, on HIGH for 20-25 minutes, or
                        until the noodles are cooked.</li>

                    <li>When the noodles are tender, stir again, have a taste and adjust seasonings to your preferences.
                        Serve in bowls with fresh chopped parsley on top.</li>
                </ol>
