        <h1>Crochet for Beginners</h1>
        <p>
            Since my only hobby is to crochet, I thought I'd write a beginner's guide on how to start! This can be picked up by anyone with
            any skill level, and there are plenty of free patterns online so you never run out of things to do.
            It is the perfect secondary activity to do while listening to music or watching TV. It can help with circulation in the hands to prevent arthritis or 
            carpal tunnel. Also, it can be extremely fulfilling to make something with your own two hands in this digital day and age.

        <h2>Tools Needed</h2>
        <p>
            All of these items are pretty cheap, and there even is a busniess called the 
            <a href= "https://thewoobles.com/">Woobles</a> which will send you a kit so you don't have to buy it all yourself. But, if starting from scratch 
            is something you are interested in, you only need a hanful of things to get started. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crochet Hook (aluminum/wood works best)</li>
            <li>Heavy Weighted Yarn (bigger yarn is better for beginners)</li>
            <li>Tapestry Needle</li>
            <li>Scissors</li>
            <li>Stitch Markers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Free Patterns</h2>
        <p>
            2 of the easiest things someone can make while crocheting is giant squares, and the following patterns are just that. 
            The base elements of these tutorials are rectangles and squares which can have endless combinations. These stitches that these patterns use
            can add some wonderful visual texture, but they are so easy you will be doing them without looking in no time.
